This directory is the EDB database of the LaTeX document.

EDB is simple database for Emacs, you can obtain it from:
http://pag.lcs.mit.edu/~mernst/software/

Files in this directory:
- latex-doc.edb: the database in internal layout of EDB,
- latex-doc.fmt: the format file for the database,
- latex-doc.dba: the auxillary file for the database.

To export the database so that it can be used in `latex-doc-data.el' file:
- Load the database (provided you have installed and configured the EDB package
  properly):
	M-x db-find-file <RET>
	Enter: <path>/latex-doc.edb <RET>
- Disable the usage of internal file layout:
	C-u 0 M-x db-toggle-internal-file-layout <RET>
- Export to some file:
	C-x C-w <RET>
  Save the database something say "out.el"
- Make necessary changes out.el => latex-doc-data.el
